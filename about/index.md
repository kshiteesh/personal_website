Hello!  

Welcome to my page! My name is Kshiteesh Hegde. I'm a Graduate Student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.rpi.edu/) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu/). I'm working on Matrix Reconstruction techniques for various Machine Learning applications. I'm also interested in Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, Data Science, Social Networks and Recommendation Systems.   

During my leisure time, I love to watch soccer, F1 and tennis. I also try to travel whenever I can. I will be writing here about my travel stories and experiences among other things.   

Feel free to [email me](mailto:kshiteesh@hegde.me) if you have anything to say. Alternatively, you can use the appropriate comments sections if you have specific things to say about my posts.   

Have a nice day!
