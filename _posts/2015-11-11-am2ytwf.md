This is going to be a  short post. I have often found myself trying to share music with people who don't have [Apple Music](http://www.apple.com/music/) subscription (or any other streaming music service for that matter). I'm listening to a song, I like it and I want to share it. Just use the built-in share sheet right? No, that gives the iTunes link which is not very useful in this premise. Enter [Workflow](https://workflow.is) ([Direct Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334)).

Get the name of the current song, Google it and get the first link (usually this is a link to YouTube most of the time, unless it is a very obscure song), share[^1] this link. This is what [this](https://workflow.is/workflows/a42c53452c3e4477a5681b7795fbb6b1) workflow (that I put together in a few minutes) does.

In case you want to include the name of the song with the link, you can use [this](https://workflow.is/workflows/528cd77cde274833982205f94c097649) one.

[^1]: Protip: To be absolutely sure you are sharing the right link, you can use this free extension called [Browse Securely](http://martingordon.me) ([Direct Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/browsecurely-secure-browsing/id1044135314)) which opens the link using [SafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-504/) in place.
